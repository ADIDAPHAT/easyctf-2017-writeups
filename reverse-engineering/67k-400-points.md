# 67k - 400 points

[Here](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2017-problems/blob/master/r3ndom-67k/bins.zip) are 67k binaries, well more accurately 67,139 binaries. Solve every single one, append the results together in order \(shouldn't be too difficult as the binaries are numbered\) and then from there I'm sure you can figure it out.
