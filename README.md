## Contributing

We really appreciate all the hard work you guys put into solving these problems, so if you spent your time writing a writeup, we'd like to feature it here! But since these writeups will be provided to and read by everyone, we'd like to keep the writeups as orderly as possible.

If no one has written a writeup for a certain problem, by all means, write one! This is also an excellent way to gain recognition for your CTF team. If there is already a writeup posted, feel free to leave an external link \(for example, to your CTF team's blog or a Github markdown file\) in the External Writeups section. All submissions will be reviewed before they are posted to the official writeups book.

For reference, the source files for the problems have been open-sourced and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2017-problems).

**To submit your writeup link, fork **[**this repository**](https://github.com/EasyCTF/easyctf-2017-writeups)**, add your link, and submit a pull request; an organizer will review it shortly. Please follow the format of existing problems.**
